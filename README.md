# Adaptive-Traffic-Light-Control

"This is a college project"

## OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT 

1.To eliminate the delay on roads by reducing traffic and controlling the signals automatically by monitoring real time vehicle density using video processing.

2.To provide security surveillance at road intersections.

3.To have virtual display of control system

## timerturtle.py

In this python program we are going to see the virtula display of out traffic light control system. We have used turtel to create the the graphics.
